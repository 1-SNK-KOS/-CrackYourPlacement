# [169. Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/description/)

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:** 

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

**Follow-up:**  Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?

```cpp

class Solution {
public:
    int majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int no = nums[0];
        int freq = 1;
        int n = nums.size();

        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(no == nums[i])freq++;
            else if(freq > 0 && no!=nums[i])freq--;
            else {
                freq =1;
                no = nums[i];
            }
        }

        return no;
    }
};

```


**Intution**  

It is the standard question and on based of logic that if the element is more than n/2 then at the last we I delete for the number for another number than one of its kind will be left as it is one extra atleast
