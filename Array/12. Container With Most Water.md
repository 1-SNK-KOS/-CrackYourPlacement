# [11. Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/description/)

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i^th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

**Notice**  that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:** 
<img alt="" src="https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 287px;">

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:** 

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 10^4`  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int n = height.size();
        int st = 0 ,en = n-1;
        int area = 0;

        while(st<en){
           area = max(area , (en-st)*min(height[st],height[en]));
           if(height[st]<height[en])st++;
           else en--;
        }  
        
        return area;
    }
};

```  


***Intution***
As we want maximum area - we can have control over breadth and length is uncertain we don't so start from max breadth possible i.e st to en and len try to find bigger len in compare to st and en
