# [496. Next Greater Element I](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-greater-element-i/description/)

The **next greater element**  of some element `x` in an array is the **first greater**  element that is **to the right**  of `x` in the same array.

You are given two **distinct 0-indexed**  integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`.

For each `0 <= i < nums1.length`, find the index `j` such that `nums1[i] == nums2[j]` and determine the **next greater element**  of `nums2[j]` in `nums2`. If there is no next greater element, then the answer for this query is `-1`.

Return an array `ans` of length `nums1.length` such that `ans[i]` is the **next greater element**  as described above.

**Example 1:** 

```
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2]
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
- 1 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. The next greater element is 3.
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,3,4,2]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation: The next greater element for each value of nums1 is as follows:
- 2 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. The next greater element is 3.
- 4 is underlined in nums2 = [1,2,3,4]. There is no next greater element, so the answer is -1.
```

**Constraints:** 

- `1 <= nums1.length <= nums2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^4`
- All integers in `nums1` and `nums2` are **unique** .
- All the integers of `nums1` also appear in `nums2`.

**Follow up:**  Could you find an `O(nums1.length + nums2.length)` solution?  

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> nextGreaterElement(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int n = nums1.size();
        int m = nums2.size();

        if(n == 1 && m == 1)return {-1};

        stack<int>s;
        // vector<int>greater(m,-1);
        unordered_map<int,int>greater;

// finding the nxt greater in nums2
        for(int i=m-1;i>=0;i--){

            while(!s.empty()){
                if(nums2[i]<s.top()){
                    greater[nums2[i]] = s.top();
                    s.push(nums2[i]);
                    break;
                }
                else s.pop();
            }
            
            if(s.empty()){
                s.push(nums2[i]);
                greater[nums2[i]] = -1;
                continue;
                }
        }
// filling for the query in nums1
        vector<int>ans(n,0);
        
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            ans[i] = greater[nums1[i]];
        }
       
        return ans;
    }
};
```  

***Intution***
When l->r approach has T.C more then try to think of r->l approach and when w want to follow a increasing or decreasing approach use stack
